// STRINGS (Exercise 3 of 19)  
 
// A string is a sequence of characters. A character is, roughly speaking, a  
// written symbol. Examples of characters are letters, numbers, punctuation  
// marks, and spaces.  
 
// String values are surrounded by either single or double quotation marks.  
 
//    'this is a string'  
     
//    "this is also a string"  
 
// NOTE  
 
// Try to stay consistent. In this workshop we'll only use single quotation  
// marks.  
 
// The challenge:  
 
// For this challenge, create a file named strings.js.  
 
// In that file create a variable named someString like this:  
 
//    var someString = 'this is a string';  

var someString = 'this is a string';
 
// Use console.log to print the variable someString to the terminal.  

console.log(someString);
 
// Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:  
 
// javascripting verify strings.js
